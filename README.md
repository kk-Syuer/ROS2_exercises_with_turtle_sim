# 🐢 ROS2 Workspace — Learning Robotics with Turtlesim

Welcome to **`ros2_ws`**, a hands-on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) learning workspace.  
This project was developed step-by-step to understand the **core ROS 2 communication concepts** — **Topics**, **Services**, **Parameters**, **Actions**, and **Launch files** — using the classic 🐢 **Turtlesim** simulator.

---

## 🧭 Overview

This workspace contains several Python-based ROS 2 packages.  
Each one introduces a key component of the ROS 2 ecosystem and builds toward the final “**Patrolling Turtle**” project — a full asynchronous action server guiding the turtle across multiple waypoints.

## 🧠 Packages Summary

| Package | Concept | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `py_pubsub` | **Topics** | Demonstrates message publishing/subscribing with `/turtle1/cmd_vel`. |
| `py_srvcli` | **Services** | Implements a simple service-client pair (e.g., add two integers). |
| `python_parameters` | **Parameters** | Shows how to declare, get, and dynamically modify parameters. |
| `turtle_square_py` | **Composite Behaviors** | Contains advanced turtle scripts, including movement patterns, color effects, and action servers. |
| `patrol_interfaces` | **Custom Action Interface** | Defines the `PatrolCommandInterface.action` used in the Patrolling Turtle exercise. |
| `action_tutorials_interfaces` | **Example Actions** | Standard `Fibonacci.action` used for learning how to create and use actions. |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim \
                 python3-colcon-common-extensions \
                 python3-rosdep
````

### 2️⃣ Build the Workspace

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/setup.bash
```

### 3️⃣ Verify Packages

```bash
ros2 pkg list | grep turtle
```

You should see your custom packages listed.

## 🚀 How to Run the Demos

### 🧩 Topics Example

```bash
ros2 run py_pubsub turtle_publisher
ros2 run py_pubsub turtle_subscriber
```

### 🧩 Services Example

```bash
ros2 run py_srvcli service
ros2 run py_srvcli client 2 3
```

### 🧩 Parameters Example

```bash
ros2 run python_parameters minimal_param_node
ros2 param set /minimal_param_node my_parameter earth
```

### 🧩 Launch File Example (two turtles mimicking)

```bash
ros2 launch turtle_square_py turtlesim_mimic_launch.py
```

### 🧩 Rainbow Client Example

```bash
ros2 run turtle_square_py rainbow_client
```

---

## 🏁 Final Project — The Patrolling Turtle

This is a full **ROS 2 Action Server** that guides the turtle through a sequence of coordinates, providing **feedback** after each waypoint.

### 1️⃣ Run Turtlesim

```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```

### 2️⃣ Start the Patrol Server

```bash
ros2 run turtle_square_py patrol_command
```

### 3️⃣ Send Patrol Coordinates (Action Goal)

```bash
ros2 action send_goal /command_turtle patrol_interfaces/action/PatrolCommandInterface \
"targets: [{x: 9.0, y: 7.0, z: 0.0}, {x: 5.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0}, {x: 1.0, y: 7.0, z: 0.0}, {x: 2.0, y: 9.0, z: 0.0}]" --feedback
```

### ✅ Expected Behavior

* The turtle rotates toward the first target.
* Moves straight until it reaches it.
* Sends feedback each time a point is reached.
* Continues until all coordinates are visited.

🎥 *(The motion resembles a smooth patrol route — or a polygonal path depending on your gains.)*

---

## 🧮 Inside the Action Server

The **`PatrollingActionServer`**:

* Subscribes to `/turtle1/pose` to track the turtle’s position.
* Publishes to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` to control linear & angular velocity.
* Uses **`MultiThreadedExecutor`** to handle pose updates while performing long-running loops.
* Provides **feedback** for each reached point and **result** when finished.

Custom action file:
`patrol_interfaces/action/PatrolCommandInterface.action`

```action
# Goal
geometry_msgs/Point[] targets
---
# Result
bool done
---
# Feedback
int32 current_index
```
